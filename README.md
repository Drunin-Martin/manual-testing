## Introduction

[Provide a brief overview of the website being tested and the purpose of manual testing. Explain why manual testing is necessary despite automated testing tools.]

Welcome to Testbytes, a comprehensive platform dedicated to exploring the intricacies of manual and automation testing. Our website serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking to enhance their understanding of software testing methodologies.

Despite automation's efficiency, manual testing remains essential for uncovering nuanced issues and ensuring a seamless user experience. Our documentation of manual testing efforts on [website name] highlights the importance of hands-on exploration in complementing automated approaches and improving software quality.

## Test Case Types

### Functional Testing

Functional testing checks an application, website, or system to ensure that it is doing exactly what it is meant to.

In the planning stages, every project creates a document listing functional or requirement specifications. Essentially, it is a list of what the app/system/website is supposed to do from a userâ€™s perspective.


* Smoke/Sanity Testing

Explain how compatibility tests were performed to ensure the website works correctly across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes. List the browsers and devices tested, along with any compatibility issues encountered.

* Unity Testing

Explain how compatibility tests were performed to ensure the website works correctly across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes. List the browsers and devices tested, along with any compatibility issues encountered.


### Non - Functional Testing

As the name suggets, it checks the non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc) of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.

* Performance Testing

Detail the performance tests executed to assess the website's responsiveness, load times, and resource utilization. Include information on tools used for performance monitoring and any performance bottlenecks identified.

 * Usability Testing

Discuss the tests carried out to evaluate the website's ease of use and user experience. Mention aspects such as navigation clarity, layout consistency, and overall user satisfaction.

## Test Cases

Provide a list of specific test cases used during manual testing. Organize them by testing type and include steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results for each test case.

**Example:**

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test Case 1: Login Functionality
     - Steps to Reproduce:
       1. Navigate to the login page.
       2. Enter valid username and password.
       3. Click the login button.
     - Expected Result: User should be logged in successfully.
     - Actual Result: User is redirected to the dashboard upon successful login.

   (Include similar test cases for other functionality tests, usability tests, compatibility tests, and performance tests)

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings from manual testing, highlighting any critical issues discovered and recommendations for improvement. Mention any follow-up actions, such as retesting after fixes or additional test coverage.
